# Twitter Analysis Shiny App

A simple Shiny application written in R that visualizes Twitter data.

This performs a Twitter search (by term or user), runs a sentiment analysis on the tweets, and a principle component analysis for the 100 most common terms (other than the search term). Visualizations are avalable for the sentiments and the PCA by themselves and as a function of time. Also returns a table sampling tweets based on their PCA values.

This was produced as part of the [Essentials of Data Science](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2016/04/data-science-essentials-of-data-science.html) workshop I attended in 2016 (now hosted by [Byteflow Dynamics](http://www.byteflows.com/events/eds-1.html)). This code is not actively maintained, but feel free to grab a copy if you'd like to run or modify it.
