# Twitter Analysis Shiny App

A simple Shiny application written in R that visualizes Twitter data.

This performs a Twitter search, runs a sentiment analysis on the tweets, and a principle component analysis for the 100 most common terms (other than the search term). Visualizations are avalable for the sentiments and the PCA, as well as a table sampling tweets based on their PCA values.
